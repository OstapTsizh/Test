Client isn't being notified by mqtt plugin if message is not delivered

Short description what code does:
I am using pub/sub pattern with QoS-1.
Publisher & Subscriber connect to broker via websockets, publisher sends message every 5 sec.
I have a rabbitmq server maintenance several times per week. As a result of that maintenance - server restarts and all queues are lost.
I need publisher to be acknowledged if it publishes message that is not delivered to subscriber, so I can resubscribe last.


Environment setup:
- .NET Core 3.0
- RabbitMQ 3.7
- Plugin: Mqtt
- Client Lib: MQTTnet (https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet)

Code example can be found here: https://github.com/OstapTsizh/Test

Steps to reproduce:
- Run 'docker-compose -f docker-compose-brokers.yml up' from root folder
- Run 'dotnet run' from project folder (src/Test/)
- http://localhost:15672/#/queues (username="test", pass="test")
- Delete Queue mqtt-subscription-subscriberqos1

Publish returns MqttClientPublishResult

Expected result:
Exception or MqttClientPublishResult.ReasonCode = MqttClientPublishReasonCode.NoMatchingSubscribers

Actual result:
MqttClientPublishResult.ReasonCode = Success
